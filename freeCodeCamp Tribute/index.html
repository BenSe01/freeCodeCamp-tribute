              " Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can
              meet the demand,<br> as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
              are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time.<br> Long before we called
              it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
